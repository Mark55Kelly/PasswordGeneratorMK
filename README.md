# PasswordGeneratorMK
Password generator 
The password generator runs and requires the user to enter a prompt of how many characters they want their password to be. 
Once they select the "Generate Password" button, the user goes through a set of confirm messages. 
after all the confirm messages are entered. A password is generated based on which confirm messages were "ok" to include.
The password should only contain the number of characters from our Prompt of how many characters we want the password to be with a random selection of characters.
